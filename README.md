中文简介

这个程序能从学术期刊类 PDF 文件中提取文本并保存为 DOCX 文件。程序能够识别并合并跨页的正文段落，同时将脚注单独提取，改为尾注，以便于后续的编辑和使用，譬如全文翻译。程序只针对文本类pdf，未有提取图片功能。另外，脚注的识别、正文段落的合并仍不完美，本人能力有限，期待各大神完善其功能。


English Description

This program can extract text from academic journal-style PDF files and save it as a DOCX file. The program is capable of identifying and merging body paragraphs that span multiple pages while extracting footnotes separately and converting them into endnotes to facilitate subsequent editing and use, such as full-text translation. The program focuses solely on text-based PDFs and does not include image extraction functionality. However, the recognition of footnotes and the merging of body paragraphs remain imperfect due to my limited abilities. Suggestions and improvements from experts are highly welcome.
